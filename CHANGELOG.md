All notable changes to this plugin are documented here, for someone deciding whether to
upgrade — not the commit log. The format follows

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), read against
[ADR 0016](docs/adrs/0016-break-compatibility-freely-before-1-0.md): before 1.0, a
breaking change gets a line here rather than a deprecation window.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **Obsidian 1.12.0 or newer is now required** (was 1.10.2). The Bases custom-view API
  opened in 1.10.2, but a view's options callback was not handed the base's own
  configuration until 1.12.0 — so on older versions this view's options menu showed the
  shipped `docs/…` folders as the type-folder defaults inside any other base, and offered
  no WIP-limit or column-policy box at all. Nothing else was affected: the tree, the board
  and the roadmap all worked. Obsidian keeps serving 0.6.0 to vaults below the new floor.

### Removed

- The fallback that produced those defaults when no configuration arrived. Requiring the
  floor is what makes the options menu describe the base it is open in, always.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-10
